## Data & Storage

All data is stored in `localStorage` under these keys:

| Key | Contents |
|---|---|
| `sr_companies` | Company accounts and earnings |
| `sr_customers` | Customer accounts |
| `sr_vehicles` | Fleet with map coordinates and pricing (TND) |
| `sr_rentals` | All rental records |
| `sr_data_version` | Version key — bumped to wipe stale data on updates |
| `sr_theme` | User's last selected theme (light/dark) |

Session (clears on tab close): `sr_user` in `sessionStorage`.

> **Note:** Bumping `DATA_VERSION` in `data.js` wipes all localStorage on next load and reinitializes with fresh mock data. Use this whenever the data schema changes.

## Theme

### Light Mode
- Background: `#c8d6e5` (slate-300) — white cards visibly contrast
- Cards: `#ffffff` with `1.5px solid #94a3b8` border
- Text: `#0f172a` (slate-900)
- Accent: `#0d9488` (teal-600)

### Dark Mode
- Background: `#0a0f1e` (deep navy)
- Cards: `#111827` (gray-900)
- Text: `#f0f9ff`
- Accent: `#2dd4bf` (teal-300)

Vuetify's internal `--v-medium-emphasis-opacity` is forced to `1` in both themes to prevent text from being dimmed invisible.
